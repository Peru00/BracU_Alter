1. connect theimu first 
then connect the Rplider 



run ---


source /home/bracualter-base/alter_ws/install/setup.bash && ros2 launch cartographer_slam cartographer_2d.launch.py

add map topic and chage the fixed frame to base link 

to save the map runn 


ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/alter_ws/my_map --image-format tiff



ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli \
  -f ~/alter_ws/my_map \
  --image-format geotiff \
  --mode trinary \
  --free 0.25 \
  --occ 0.65




Error May mention ::

if the imu is not publishingdata or if the lider is rotating slow no map is updatedting or poor map quality 

the problem might be 
as Both IMU and RPLidar use the same Silicon Labs CP210x USB-to-serial chip with identical vendor ID (10c4) and product ID (ea60). The original udev rules matched any device with these IDs, so when both devices were connected, the symlinks got confused.

The Fix: updated imu_usb.rules to use the unique serial number (ATTRS{serial}=="0001") to distinguish your IMU from other devices to imu_usb.rules

Now when you connect both devices:

imu_usb → IMU (serial 0001)
The RPLidar can use its own port or you can similarly update its udev rule with its serial number
To test: Start your IMU node again with both devices connected:
ros2 launch wit_ros2_imu rviz_and_imu.launch.py


Note: If your IMU serial is different from 0001, you can find the correct serial by unplugging the RPLidar, then running:

udevadm info -a -n /dev/ttyUSB0 | grep serial
